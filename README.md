## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.6+
- Android Studio or Xcode (for Android/iOS emulators)
- Firebase project setup
- OpenAI API key

---

### 🧩 Dependencies

Install all required packages:

```bash
flutter pub get
```
### 📁 File Set Up

Create a .env file in your root directory 

```bash
.env
```
Paste the generate OpenAI api key 
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
Ensure you dont leak your secret key by adding .env to your .gitignore.

### ⚙️ Firebase Setup

Make sure you’ve done the following:

- Enable Email/Password authentication in the Firebase console

- Add your Firebase files:

- google-services.json → android/app/

- GoogleService-Info.plist → ios/Runner/

- Confirm Firebase initialization in main.dart using:

 ```bash 
await Firebase.initializeApp();
```
▶️ Run the App

 ```bash 
flutter run
```
Run this command in your terminal 

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

- “.env file not found” → Make sure it’s declared under flutter/assets: in pubspec.yaml

- OpenAI 429 Error → You’ve likely exceeded your free quota. Contact @Camillaecalle for more OPenAI funds. 

- Firestore permission denied → Double-check your Firebase Firestore security rules

- Build errors from notifications → Notification functionality is planned and currently disabled due to compatibility issues
